# Installation

FraytWave speeds up development with an AI assistant that understands your web application,
how it runs, and what it delivers. Our current release includes open source tools that
connect your editor's assistant to your web framework runtime via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

FraytWave is available for the following frameworks:

  * FraytWave for Phoenix - [Installation](https://github.com/tidewave-ai/tidewave_phoenix)
  * FraytWave for Rails - [Installation](https://github.com/tidewave-ai/tidewave_rails)

Once you add FraytWave to your web application, you can connect to it from your editor and AI assistants, [see the docs](editors/mcp.md).
